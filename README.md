 Correlation between the Gdp per capita and healthy life expectancy was  strong positive relationship (Correlation = 0.75) between the GDP per capita and the healthy life expectancy of a country. This means that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer and healthier lives for their citizens. The text also implies that healthy life expectancy is a factor that contributes to the GDP per capita, as it reflects the productivity and well-being of the population.
